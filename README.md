Removing the numpad from a Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboard

## Motivation

I have been working on computers since an early age, but given ergonomics little to no consideration until in early 2000-teens, when I developed severe wrist and back palm pain from mouse and keyboard use, culminating with a forced vacation to give my hand time to heal, and using the mouse with my left hand, when I really had to, or pain in my right hand was too much.

I started exploring vertical or ergonomic mice and keyboards, but soon realised my posture was off-tilt due to the far right placement of the mouse, next to the numpad part of the typical keyboards.

When a work colleague recommended me the Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboard I was first fearful I would not adapt to the split layout. But that part was easy, while I found the keyboard extremely comfortable and easy on the wrists, especially with the tilt support it has.

I bought my own Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboard in 2019 and have been using it ever since.

The same colleague who recommended the keyboard had 2 broken such keyboards, victims of spilled tea or drinks. Since searching for ergonomic split layout numpadless or left side placed numpad keyboards yielded no acceptable results, I asked my colleague if he would donate his broken keyboards, with the intent to repair and then cut off the numpad to get a more narrow keyboard, so my right hand would stay not as wide as forced by the numpads.

## About

This repository documents my findings in this exploration, in the hope it might be useful to somebody, although the Natural 4000 model has been discontinued since somewhere around 2019-2020, if not earlier.
